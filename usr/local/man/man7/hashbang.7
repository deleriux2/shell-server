.SH NAME
#! \- "shell" service and collective of awesome people.

.SH SYNOPSIS

bash <(curl hashbang.sh)

.SH DESCRIPTION

We are a diverse community of people who love teaching, and learning.
Putting a #! at the beginning of a "script" style program tells a computer that
it needs to "do something" or "execute" this file. Likewise, we are a community
of people that like to "do stuff".

If you like technology, and you want to learn to write your first program, learn
to use Linux, or even take on interesting challenges with some of the best in
the industry, you are in the right place.

.SH HISTORY

2004 - Free-for-all usage of a dedicated server hosted at a "The Planet" 
datacenter in Austin, TX was secured by lrvick. This was made available to him
via an educational web application provider in exchange for free system
administration services. Shell accounts were given out to a group of friends
for personal projects and organized resources and efforts via IRC.

2006 - Having outgrown our shared hosting, the community opted to invest ain 
a dedicated server to move our projects to lovingly named "Adam". A few months
later "Eve" was added for redundancy and downtime minimization.
These were hosted at "SiteGenie" in in Rochester, MN.

2008 - At this time we were hosting many web projects with hundreds of 
thousands of users, as well as hundreds of users on our IRC/shell services. Our
community was gaining a reputation in multiple IRC circles and we prided
ourselves in our overall system security regularly dealing with attacks of many
kinds. A "Script Kiddie" by the name of Piratox  whom had access to a large
botnet decided on a show of power against out network. Being unable to get in
via usual methods, he opted to disrupt us via a large scale A DDOS attack.

The attack was significant enough that the entire SiteGenie datacenter was
taken offline. We managed to track down Piratox and end the dispute however 
SiteGenie concluded that they were unprepared to mitigate DDOS attacks of this
scale and promptly ended our contract. They offered to overnight our harddrives
to locations of our choosing. Seeing this potential as a possibility, backup
plans were already in motion.

"Noah" was brought online in the Ohio basement of volunteer admin Echelon.
Volunteer admin Bluescales rushed the setup of a VPS in a Montana Datacenter.
He dubbed it "Moses". We quickly routed essential services from backups between
the two servers while one of the two backup drives containing user files was
overnighted to Noah, to make shell user files available to our community again
within 24 hours.

With emergency options in place we sought a new primary server. After
reviewing our budget and options we opted for a dedicated server at 
VolumeDrive, in Wilkes Barre, Pennsylvania. We took a chance on them as a newer
company due to their reputation for their very inexpensive unmetered bandwidth
plans, and lots of bandwidth testing. "Melchiz" was born.

"Melchiz" became responsible for community services like shells/email/irc, and
most smaller websites.

VolumeDrive was a good fit for most of our services however, like SiteGenie, 
they would be unwilling to deal with the unwanted attention that our more
popular services could bring. To address this we deployed "Samson" in an
undisclosed location to ensure it would be difficult to target by disruptive
parties. In order to reliably protect the servers location, "Gideon" was
deployed in Germany as a dumb proxy. Were it to ever go down, more could rapidly
take its place. We felt really good about the maintainability of this setup.

2010 - In an attempt to provide better security for Samson a kernel update was
needed. One of our volunteer admins, Viaken, decided to take on the kernel
update on his own, and neglected to include the correct SATA driver. On reboot
Samson was unable to boot. As per a special agreement with the datacenter to get
free hosting, support could never be contacted about this machine, thus Samson
was to remain frozen at a kernel panic screen. It may well be hung there to this
day. This also removed the purpose of Gideon which was taken offline shortly
after.

We were left with no choice but to risk hosting all services on Melchiz until
a better solution could be secured.

2013 - After frequent downtime and multiple disputes with VolumeDrive
(including a case where they mistakenly formatted one of our production hard
drives), we sought as a community to "go big or go home". We went big and
secured the dedicated server "og". The specs of og were more than overkill for
everything we provide, but we knew it would be worth it for our long-term
goals of widening our free community offerings to the general public. 

2014 - #! shells are now available to the general public. Welcome!
